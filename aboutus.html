					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>We understand the unique challenges companies face when they utilize Open Source (OS) Software.</p>

					<strong>Open Studio Labs</strong> is a pioneering research and development lab dedicated to solving the
					critical challenge of
					open source (OS) software talent shortages. We stand out with our unique <strong>Engineering Residency
						(ER)</strong> model, the
					<em>"first-of-its-kind."</em> This model equips highly skilled U.S.-based engineers to contribute to crucial
					open
					source ecosystems, helping enterprises tackle mounting technical debt, mitigate security vulnerabilities,
					and support under-supported OS projects.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Our Mission</strong> is to support enterprises by developing a sustainable talent pipeline of skilled
					people proficient in upstream OS work. This allows companies to focus on innovation and customer needs,
					confident they are not hindered by technical debt challenges.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Our Approach</strong> Inspired by the medical residency model, our residences follow a "See It, Learn
					It, Teach It" methodology, delivering hands-on solutions for the growing complexities in OS software. We aim
					to
					close the void between talent famine and the ever-increasing need for secure, efficient, OS
					projects that companies trust.

					<strong>What We Offer</strong> is a <em>first-of-its-kind</em> residency designed to train and mentor people
					in OS software here at Open Studio Labs. Our company, based in the U.S., equips individuals to work on
					crucial OS projects that reduce technical debt, strengthen security, and support long-term project
					sustainability.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Who We Help</strong> Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) and engineering leaders from midsize (MSE)
					to global enterprises who rely heavily on OS software for their operations. These leaders face
					challenges in attracting and retaining skilled talent, mitigating security risks, and maintaining operational
					efficiencyâ€”all while innovating and staying ahead of regulatory requirements.
