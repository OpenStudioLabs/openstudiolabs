					<h1>About Us</h1>
					< <p>We understand the unique challenges companies face <br /> when they utilize Open-Source Software.
						</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>Open Studio Labs</strong> is a pioneering research and development lab dedicated to solving the
					critical challenge of
					open source software talent shortages. We stand out with our unique residency model, the
					"first-of-its-kind." This model equips highly skilled U.S.-based engineers to contribute to crucial open
					source ecosystems, helping enterprises tackle mounting technical debt, mitigate security vulnerabilities,
					and support under-supported open source projects.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Our Mission</strong> is to support enterprises by developing a sustainable talent pipeline of skilled
					engineers
					proficient in upstream open source work. This allows companies to focus on innovation and customer needs,
					confident they are not hindered by technical debt challenges.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Our Approach</strong> Inspired by the medical residency model, our engineers follow a "See It, Learn
					It, Teach It"
					methodology, delivering hands-on solutions for the growing complexities in open source software. We aim to
					close the void between talent famine and the ever-increasing need for secure, efficient, open source
					projects that companies trust.
				</p>

				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>What We Offer</strong> is a first-of-its-kind residency program designed to train and mentor engineers
					in open source software here at Open Studio Labs. Our company, based in the U.S., equips engineers to work on
					crucial open source projects that reduce technical debt, strengthen security, and support long-term project
					sustainability.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Who We Help</strong> are Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) and engineering leaders from midsize (MSE)
					to global enterprises who rely heavily on open source software for their operations. These leaders face
					challenges in attracting and retaining skilled talent, mitigating security risks, and maintaining operational
					efficiencyâ€”all while innovating and staying ahead of regulatory requirements.
				</p>
				<p><strong> How We Solve Problems</strong> By participating investing in an Open Studio Labs Sponsorship,
					enterprises gain access to a dedicated talent pipeline of specialized open source engineers who:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Address critical upstream issues in open source projects</li>
					<li>Help reduce technical debt through focused, trained contributions</li>
					<li>Contribute to strengthening security practices in open source development</li>
				</ul>

				<p> Our engineers provide the skills needed to keep companies competitive, focusing on security, operational
					efficiency, and innovation without the need to divert internal resources. In addition, our transparent KPI-
					driven model ensures that businesses see tangible benefits from day one.
					Join us, support open source, and become a founding sponsor today.
